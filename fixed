# ðŸ“¢ Diddy-Bot Announcement

Hey everyone!

For the past couple of months, **Diddy-Bot** has been experiencing crashes due to a lack of RAM. We know this has been frustrating, and we really appreciate your patience.

ðŸ’¡ **Good news** â€” we've recently switched to a new hosting service! This upgrade should fix the stability issues and help Diddy-Bot run much more smoothly moving forward.

If you notice any problems or bugs, please report them in our [Diddy-Bot Community Server](https://discord.gg/u6AVRt7Bgm).

I would also like to thank **Houdert** (aka *Pizza Margherita*), my amazing Developer, for all their help in getting things back on track.

**â€“ Unprankable, Founder of Diddy-Bot**
