### 🌟 **Introducing the Aura System – Powered by Diddy-Bot!** 🌟  

We’re excited to unveil **Diddy-Bot's Aura System**, a feature that tracks and rewards your engagement based on activity. Your **Aura** reflects your influence in the server. Here's how it works:

---

### ⚙️ **How Aura is Calculated** ⚙️  

1️⃣ **Message Score:**  
Every message earns a score:  
> `25 + (Message Length / 20) + 30 for each image, link, GIF, or attachment.`  

2️⃣ **Every Minute:**  
Diddy-Bot updates your Aura based on:  
> **Aura** = `Message Total × Multiplier`  
> **Sigma Level** = `Aura / 150`  

3️⃣ **Timeout Penalties:**  
Timeouts reduce your Aura:  
> `100 × Timeout Hours × Multiplier`  

4️⃣ **Message Deletion:**  
Deleting messages lowers your Aura:  
> `Message Score × Multiplier × 2`

### 🌌 **Why the Aura System?**  
The Aura System encourages meaningful interactions and highlights your contributions.  

💬 **Check your Aura with** `/getaura` and climb the ranks!
